# COMP341 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 

You can find my solutions to the homeworks and projects for Spring 2024

<b>Project 1:</b> Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world. <br>
<b>Project 2:</b> implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms. <br>
<b>Homework 3:</b> Homework about probability <br>
<b>Project 3:</b> Implemented exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters. <br>
<b>Project 4:</b> Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for pacman. <br>
